        <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take ti in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser of Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span>Variable Declaration</span> JavaScript variables are containers for sorting data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee,<br> a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers.<em> var x;</em></li>
          <li><span>Variable Assignment</span> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our <br>variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <em>var x = 10;</em></li>
          <li><span>Data Types</span> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types <br> that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <em>true</em> or <em>false;</em> null - <em>null</em> aka nothing; Number - <em>42</em> or <em>3.14159;</em> String - <em>"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</em><br>Array - <em>[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</em> and Object - <em>{first_name:'Jane',last_name:'Doe'}</em></li>
          <li><span>Conditionals</span> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on <br>values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following <br>conditional statements: <em>if</em> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <em>else if</em> to specify a new condition to test, if the first <br>condition is false; <em>else</em> we execute this block of code;</li>
          <li><span>Loops</span> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat <br>an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!</li>
          <li><span>Function</span> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of <br> instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we <br>screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! we finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more <br> tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</li>
